# Introduction

#### PostRunStretch

This is a small project to add a WearOS app which runs through a few stretches to perform after running.

The stretches come from an unlisted CouchTo5k video, so to save having to look up that video each time; why not have it on the watch which will be used for tracking activity.

# TODO:

- [x] Get stretch icons in 80x80dp, possibly from fiverr, for the different stretches which include:
