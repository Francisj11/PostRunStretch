# Introduction

#### PostRunStretch

This is a small project to add a WearOS app which runs through a few stretches to perform after running.

The stretches come from an unlisted CouchTo5k video, so to save having to look up that video each time; why not have it on the watch which will be used for tracking activity.

# TODO:

- [ ] Get stretch icons in 80x80dp, possibly from fiverr, for the different stretches which include:
  1. hipFlexor1,
  1. hipFlexor2,
  1. thighStretch1,
  1. thighStretch2,
  1. hamstringStretch1,
  1. hamstringStretch2,
  1. iliotibialBandStretch1,
  1. iliotibialBandStretch2,
  1. calfStretch1,
  1. calfStretch2,
  1. upperBodyStretch1,
  1. upperBodyStretch2,
  1. lowerBackStretch1,
  1. lowerBackStretch2,
  1. gluteStretch1,
  1. gluteStretch2.
  
- [ ] The stretches currently run for 1 second each for testing purposes but they should be 30 seconds.
  
- [ ] Improve the sounds effects which are currently voice recordings :)

- [ ] Add quit and restart buttons at the end.

- [ ] Add ability to pause by touching screen during a stretch

- [ ] Publish to PlayStore https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/distribute-wear
